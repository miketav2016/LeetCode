package difficultyLevels.easy.t26RemoveDuplicatesFromSortedArray

/**
 * Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.
 * Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
 * Clarification:
 * Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?
 * Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
